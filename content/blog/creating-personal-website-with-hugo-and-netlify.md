I recently decided to create a personal website to share my knowledge and ideas with the world. I wanted to create a website that was easy to use and maintain. I don't want to use WordPress by the way! 

I decided to built my personal website using Hugo, a fantastic Static Site Generator, and deployed it for free using Netlify.


#### Choosing Hugo

If you're not familiar with Hugo, let me give you the lowdown. It's a static site generator that means it takes your content, written in simple markdown files, and generates a complete website with static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This makes it super fast and secure. There are a number of static site generators available, but I chose Hugo because it is:

- Fast: Hugo can generate a website very quickly, even for large sites.
- Easy to use: Hugo has a simple and intuitive syntax, so it's easy to learn and use.
- Powerful: Hugo has a lot of features, so you can create a website that looks and functions exactly the way you want it to.


#### Choosing a theme

Once I decided to use Hugo, I needed to choose a theme for my website. I found a great theme called Geeky on the Statichunt website. The theme had a beautiful layout, was mobile-friendly, and came with customization options to add my personal touch. I didn't have to worry about starting from scratch, which saved me a lot of time.

#### Storing files and version control with GitHub

While building my website with Hugo, one essential aspect was managing files and ensuring version control. This is where Git, the powerful version control system, came to play a vital role. I used GitHub to store and manage the code. 


#### Deploying to Netlify

Once I was happy with the design of my website, I deployed it to Netlify. Netlify is a free service that allows you to deploy static websites. It's very easy to use, and it automatically rebuilds your website whenever you make a change to the source code.

To deploy my website to Netlify, I followed these steps:

- Created an account on Netlify.
- Connected my GitHub repository to Netlify.
- Deployed my website following few simple steps.

My website was up and running on Netlify in just a few minutes!

#### Conclusion

Building my website with Hugo and deploying it with Netlify was an empowering experience. If you're thinking about creating a personal website, I encourage you to give Hugo and Netlify a try.
