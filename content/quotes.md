# Quotes That Inspire Me

#### Quotes About Business

> To get a good idea, you need a lot of ideas." - *Linus Pauling, the only person in history to win two individual Nobel Prizes*

> Some people say, “Give the customers what they want.” But that’s not my approach. Our job is to figure out what they’re going to want before they do. Henry Ford once said, “If I’d asked customers what they wanted, they would have told me, A faster horse!” People don’t know what they want until you show it to them. - *Steve Jobs, Co-founder and CEO of Apple*


#### Quotes About Money and Wealth

> Money is a tool for freedom. The best reason to accumulate wealth is to buy yourself freedom from anything you don’t want to do, and the freedom to do the things you do want to do.
